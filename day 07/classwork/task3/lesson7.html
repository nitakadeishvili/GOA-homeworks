        <p><b>Hypertext</b> is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965 (see History ).
             <br><b>HyperMedia</b> is a term used for <b>hypertext</b>which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and sound , for example</p>

             <h2>Etymology</h2>
             <p>"(...)'Hypertext' is a recent coinage. 'Hyper-' is used in the mathematical sense of extension and generality (as in 'hyperspace,' 'hypercube') rather than the medical sense of 'excessive' ('hyperactivity'). There is no implication about size— a hypertext could contain only 500 words or so. 'Hyper-' refers to structure and not size."

                — Theodor H. Nelson, Brief Words on the Hypertext, 23 January 1967
                The English prefix "hyper-" comes from the Greek prefix "ὑπερ-" and means "over" or "beyond"; it has a common origin with the prefix "super-" which comes from Latin. It signifies the overcoming of the previous linear constraints of written text.
                
                The term "hypertext" is often used where the term "hypermedia" might seem appropriate.
                
                In 1992, author Ted Nelson – who coined both terms in 1963 [3][4]– wrote:</p>

                <p>Hypertext documents can either be static (prepared and stored in advance) or dynamic (continually changing in response to user input, such as dynamic web pages).
                    <br> Static hypertext can be used to cross-reference collections of data in documents, software applications, or books on CDs. A well-constructed system can also incorporate other user-interface conventions, such as menus and command lines.
                    <br> Links used in a hypertext document usually replace the current piece of hypertext with the destination document. A lesser known feature is StretchText, which expands or contracts the content in place, thereby giving more control to the reader in determining the level of detail of the displayed document.
                    <br> Some implementations support transclusion, where text or other content is included by reference and automatically rendered in place.

                    Hypertext can be used to support very complex and dynamic systems of linking and cross-referencing. The most famous implementation of hypertext is the World Wide Web, written in the final months of 1990 and released on the Internet in 1991.
