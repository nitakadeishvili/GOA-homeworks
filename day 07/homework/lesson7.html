        <h1>Georgia</h1>
        <p><b>Georgia</b>is a country in Eastern Europe and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region, 
            bounded by the Black Sea to the west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, 
            Armenia to the south, and Azerbaijan to the southeast. <b>Georgia</b> covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi).
            It has a population of 3.7 million,[d][18] of which over a third live in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi. <b>Georgians</b>, who are native to the region, 
            constitute a majority of the country's population and are its titular nation</p>
            <h2><i>Etymology</i></h2>
            <p><u>Ancient Greeks</u> (Strabo, Herodotus, Plutarch, Homer, etc.) and Romans (Titus Livius, Tacitus, etc.) 
            referred to early western <b>Georgians</b> as Colchians and eastern <b>Georgians</b> as Iberians (Iberoi, Ἰβηροι in some Greek sources)</p>
            <p>The first mention of the name <b>Georgia</b> is in Italian on the mappa mundi of Pietro Vesconte dated 1320. At the early stage of its appearance in the Latin world, 
                the name was often spelled Jorgia. Lore-based theories were given by traveller Jacques de Vitry, who explained the name's origin by the popularity of St. George among <b>Georgians</b>, while Jean Chardin thought that <b>Georgia</b> came from the Greek γεωργός ('tiller of the land'). 
                These centuries-old explanations for the word <b>Georgia/Georgians</b> are now mostly rejected by the scholarly community, who point to the Persian word gurğ/gurğān (گرگ, 'wolf') as the likely root of the word. Under this hypothesis,
                 the same Persian root was later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West European languages.</p>
            <h2>State name</h2>
            <p>The official name of the country is <b>Georgia</b> per Article 2 of the <b>Georgian</b> Constitution, adopted in 1995. In <b>Georgia</b>'s two official languages (<b>Georgian</b> and Abkhaz), the country is named <b>საქართველო</b> (Sakartvelo) and Қырҭтәыла (Kərttʷʼəla) respectively. 
                Prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1995 and following the dissolution of the USSR, the country was commonly[citation needed] called the "Republic of <b>Georgia</b>" and occasionally it still is.</p>
