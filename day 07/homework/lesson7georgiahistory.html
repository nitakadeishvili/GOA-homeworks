        <h1>Battle of Didgori</h1>
        <p><b>The Battle of Didgori</b> (Georgian: დიდგორის ბრძოლა, romanized: <b>Didgoris</b> brdzola) was fought between the armies of the Kingdom of Georgia and the Seljuk Empire at the narrow place of <b>Didgori</b>, 40 km west of Tbilisi,
            <br> on August 12, 1121. The large Muslim army, under the command of Ilghazi, was unable to maneuver and suffered a devastating defeat due to King David IV's effective military tactics.

          The battle at <b>Didgori</b> was the culmination of the entire Georgian–Seljuk wars and led to the Georgians' reconquest of Tbilisi in 1122. Soon after that David moved the capital from Kutaisi to Tbilisi.
          <br>The victory at <b>Didgori</b> inaugurated the medieval Georgian Golden Age and is celebrated in The Georgian Chronicles as a (Georgian: ძლევაჲ საკვირველი dzlevay sak'virveli lit. the "miraculous victory").
         <br>Modern Georgians continue to remember the event as an annual August 12 festival known as <b>Didgoroba</b> ("[the day] of Didgori").</p>

         <p>On the other side, the Georgians were facing a significantly superior foe in terms of numbers, but had the strategic as well as tactical advantage. The Georgians were well aware of the <u>Muslim</u> preparations and took necessary precautions. In 1118, after successful completion of David IV's military reform, a royal guard and a household force known as 'mona-spa', a royal servant host made up of mercenaries and lower nobility was formed.
            <br> The Georgian army of 56,000 men included 500 Alans, about 200 Franks, and 15,000 Kipchaks.

            The smallest formations would be equivalents of today's platoons "group of 20" (ოცეული), then a "group of 100" (ასეული) and so forth all led by servants of higher status and different rank. The core component of David's army was the so called mona-spa, or servant host, the personal retinue of the king, which consisted of 5,000 well-trained and heavily armored mounted warriors with lances and bows.
            <br> They were used as shock cavalry together with the nobility. The Crusaders, the Kipchak cavalry, and a small portion of infantry were deployed in the center of the Georgian army around the king's banner while the rest were equally split in two major wings initially out of sight for the Seljuqs. Each formation was headed by a great and dense line of horsemen. The heavy cavalry would smash into the enemy ranks with their lances,
            <br> joined by the infantry which would entangle the Seljuq main body in fights while the cavalry was to regroup and carry out repeated attacks till the enemy broke. At the sign of collapse, David would then send forward his Kipchak cavalry. Initially the king and all his entourage stayed in the center but would immediately switch to their respective positions when the battle commenced. During battle, David IV would assume command over his army's left wing, while Demetrius was leading the right.
            
            According to the French knight and historian Walter the Chancellor, before heading off to battle, King David inspired his army with these words:
            
            <i><b>Soldiers of Christ! If we fight bravely for our Faith, we will defeat not only the devil’s servants, but the devil himself. We will gain the greatest weapon of spiritual warfare when we make a covenant with the Almighty God and vow that we would rather die for His love than escape from the enemy. And if any one of us should wish to retreat, let us take branches and block the entrance to the gorge to prevent this. When the enemy approaches, let us attack fiercely!</b></i></p>
